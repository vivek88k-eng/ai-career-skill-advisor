# ðŸŽ¯ AI Career & Skill Development Advisor

## Overview

Students struggle to find appropriate career paths, understand what skills to learn, and secure internships based on their unique interests and strengths. This project offers an *AI-powered advisor* that analyzes individual profiles, recommends tailored career paths and courses, tracks progress, and matches users with relevant internships to guide them through their career journey.

## Problem Statement
